# Story

while walking through the muddy roads of the village
the horseman noticed a skinny man sitting on the edge under the rain like a body without soul
he got off his horse, kneeled and covered him with his blue cape to protect him from rain and cold
he took off his helmet and asked him "where can I find the king".

the man raised his head and saw
a fine soldier wearing a white armor of metal with a blue feather on his helmet
next to him a mounted horse,
with a bag, a sword, a blue flag and two heads of ogres where hanged by his back.

that town was dark during the day, not only because of the weather, but also because of its silence, despair and regrets
but while looking at that horseman, he saw the wailing of accomplishments
the man's facial features changed from desperate to astonish
he answered without hesitation "you'll find that tyrant usurper there" while pointing to the highest building of the village.

in that village the houses were high but thin, they were built one next to the other with little space between them
however he could easily see that high building in the east
the roads were not wide, they were muddy, hard to walk through but strongly guarded

two guards were walking in, they heard the man who pointed to the baron's manor
"you there! are you looking for troubles!" said a guard
"do you want a quick death instead of dying from hunger" while approaching him, he has drew his sword out of its sheath
the horseman got up, turned to him and answered "step aside inglorious dog!"
the guard raised his sword with both his hands to strike him
the horseman was fast enough to counter his attack with his arm and hit his head with the helmet
a powerful strike that brought the guard down to the ground
"your job is to protect the weak instead of threatening them!" said the horseman
the second guard charged with a low attack
the horseman through his helmet into his head to distract him
with a single blow, he has drawn his sword from the back of the horse and slashed the guard's face
he turned into the first and pointed his sword into his throat "lead me to your king"
the second guard was bleeding, but got his breath back and took a position of attack "leave this village and no one will get hurt"
"what's the meaning of this.. I came here because your king called me!"
"the baron is expecting no one"
"It was me" said an old man with a stoic voice behind them.

the old man was heading toward the poor who was laying down, bringing him clothes and food
he was wearing a tunic, hiding the top of his head with a hood
he was walking hardly because his right leg was amputated and replaced by a wooden leg
behind him was a cart full of barrels hanged to a brown horse
"lower your sword guard, you have no chance against an executioner".

the horseman put away his sword so the guard can wake up
"what are you planning old man! you wont get away with that.. all of you!" said the wounded guard
"bring your horse and walk with me" said the old man "I was waiting for you".
