### Boneless

A Zealander by birth, Boneless was a man shrouded in mystery and darkness. Abandoned by his father and orphaned at the tender age of three, he was raised in the absence of light, honing his senses in the obscurity of his surroundings. He was a phantom, a whisper in the wind, known far and wide as the stealthiest human to walk the earth. His hearing was preternatural, capable of detecting the faintest rustle miles away, and his sense of smell was sharper than any hound's. Yet, his vision was limited, unable to see beyond the tip of his nose. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, he was light on his feet, moving with a grace and silence that made him virtually undetectable. He was chosen by Kofun, the leader of the expedition, not because of familiarity, but because of the raw, untamed skill he displayed during a hunting excursion.

### Kofun

Kofun was the indomitable leader of the expedition, a beacon of intellect and strength. His mind was a labyrinth of knowledge and strategy, a testament to his exceptional intelligence. Though he was not personally acquainted with Boneless, he was captivated by the Zealander's stealth and cunning, recognizing the potential in his unconventional skills. Kofun was a force to be reckoned with, his strength and speed unparalleled. Yet, he was aware of his vulnerability, knowing that Boneless could easily slip behind him, unseen and unheard, and strike a fatal blow before he could even blink.
